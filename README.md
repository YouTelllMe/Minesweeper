# Minesweeper
Python coded minesweeper game using 2D arrays.


Note:
- you win the game if the positions of flags is the same as the position of the bombs. 

Commands:
1. General 
- input [end] to quit program
2. Board Creation
- the first step of the game is to configure a minesweeper board. The input must be in the form [number,number,number], corresponding 
to height, width, #bombs respectively. The number of bombs must not exceed the number of blocks generated by the input dimensions. 
The minimum size is 2x2 and the maximum size is 9x9(currently). 
3. Game
- input the coordinates of the block you would like to reveal. The coordinates should be indicated on the 4 sides of the board. The
input coordinate should go [y-coordinate x-coordinate] with no space in between. For example, 11 reveals (1,1). The numbers are 
counted from left to right and top to bottom. 
- to input multiple coordinates to reveal, input them the same way and separate them with a space. 
- to flag, input f+coordinate. For example, to flag (1,1), input f11
- to multiflag, only have one f in the beginning and follow each coordinate with a space. For example, f11 12 13 to flag (1,1) (1,2) and (1,3).
- to reveal the solution and quit, input "solution" during game phase.
